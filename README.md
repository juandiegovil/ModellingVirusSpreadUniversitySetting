# Modelling Virus Spread University Setting
Virus spread simulation in a university lab room environment. For containment in return to classes.

This research project, funded by the University of Calgary was done to determine what was the best Lab Room configuration on a hybrid return to classes following the COVID-19 pandemic. It was done through an agent based modeling (ABM) simulation coding program NetLogo, which uses a variation of Java programming language. Thus the code can only be run on the Netlogo software.

The simulation investigates the spread and effect COVID-19 would have against different lab room configurations. Agents (people in this case) move around the room simulating a normal lab room situation. Movement is random however governed by set of rules developed in the code. The intent was to create a program that was highly variable to different lab room configurations (number of people, tables, people per table, room size, table size, lab time etc). Before running simulations you can adjust the room configurations to whatever scenario wants to be studied. In our investigation each of these variables was tested to determine the best overall configuration to contain the spread of COVID. Results where studied and implemented in a hybrid return to classes at the university.
